# graphify
- **graphify** (`.claude/skills/graphify/SKILL.md`) - any input to knowledge graph. Trigger: `/graphify`
When the user types `/graphify`, use the installed graphify skill or instructions before doing anything else.

# Project context (2026-09-30)
- Slayer is UI-only for now: built and run on the owner's localhost, one user (the owner), no backend yet. Nothing is
  promised to anyone, so "live" wording, the sample journal and launch-readiness are not issues to raise.
- All market data is simulated (src/core/simulator.ts). Keys, a data layer and a backend come later.
- Paper and the backtest trade options only; the futures backtest and the Python engine were removed on 2026-09-30.
- Speed rules (2026-09-30 perf pass): no endless animation of a background, a shadow or an SVG part — those repaint
  every frame (the holo foil pans on appear and hover only; the clock ticks); opacity and transform loops are fine. Seeded simulator
  history is packed and its snapshots build on read (src/core/simulator.ts). Long Trace grids rest at 80 rows through
  TraceGrid's pagination. AG Grid registers only the modules listed in src/components/ui/houseGrid.ts — add one there
  when a grid needs a new feature (development names what is missing).
